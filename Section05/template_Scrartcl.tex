\section{EC2 Instance Types}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Naming Convention: m5.2xlarge
	\begin{itemize}
		\item m = instance class
		\item 5 = generation
		\item 2xlarge = size within instance class (larger size means more CPU and memory)
	\end{itemize}
	\item General purpose = T, M, A
	\item Compute optimized = C
	\item Memory optimized = R, X, z
	\item Storage optimized = I, G, H
\end{itemize}

\section{Security Groups}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Control how traffic is allowed in/out of EC2 instance
	\item only contain ALLOW rules, reference by IP or SG
	\item Lives "outside" the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it
\end{itemize}

\section{Instance Launch Types}
\begin{itemize}
	\item On demand: short workload, predictable pricing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pay for what you use
		\item Highest cost but no upfront payment
		\item Recommended for short term and un-interrupted workloads where you can't predict how the application will behave
	\end{itemize}
	\item Reserved: minimum 1 year
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 75 percent discount compared to on demand
		\item Reserve a specific instance type
		\item Recommended for steady state usage applications (think database)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Spot: short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item highest discount compared to on-demand
		\item can lose instances at any point if your max price is less than the current spot price
		\item Most cost efficient, useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
		\item like batch jobs, data analysis, image processing
	\end{itemize}
	\item Dedicated hosts: book an entire physical server, control instance placement
	\begin{itemize}
		\item allow you to use your existing server-bound software licenses
		\item allocated for a 3 yr reservation
		\item more expensive, useful for a complicated licensing model
		\item if your company has specific regulatory requirements
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spot Instance Requests}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can get up to 90 percent discount compared to on-demand
	\item Define max spot price and get the instance while current spot price < max
	\item if that limit is breached you can stop or terminate instance
	\item Spot block - block the spot instance for a specified time frame (1 to 6 hr) w/out interruptions
	\item Batch jobs, data analysis, workloads resilient to failures
	\item Not great for critical jobs/databases
	\item How to terminate spot instance?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Define spot request - the specs for your instance(s)
		\item can cancel spot request based on whether request type is one time or persistent
		\item You must cancel the spot request that is open/active/disabled and then terminate the instances
	\end{itemize}
	\item Spot fleets = set of spot instances + (optional) on-demand instances
	\item Spot fleet will try and meet target capacity with price constraints
	\item Spot fleets allow us to automatically request spot instances with the lowest price
\end{itemize}
