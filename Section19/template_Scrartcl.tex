\maketitle

\section{Serverless}
\begin{itemize}
	\item devs don't manage servers, just deploy code
	\item infrastructure is still there but the dev doesn't worry about it
	\item lambda, dynamodb, cognito, api gateway, s3, sns/sqs, kinesis, step functions, and fargate
\end{itemize}

\section{Lambda}
\begin{itemize}
	\item virtual functions - no servers to manage
	\item short executions, run on-demand, scaling is automated
	\item increasing RAM will improve CPU and network
	\item lambda container image - the image must implement the lambda runtime API
	\item ECS/Fargate is preferred for running arbitrary Docker images
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lambda Integrations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item API gateway = create REST API
	\item Kinesis = data transformations
	\item DynamoDB = insert data into DB
	\item EX: serverless thumbnail creation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item New image uploaded in S3
		\item Trigger s3 event notification a lambda function which creates a thumbnail
		\item push the new thumbnail to S3
		\item OR insert metadata into dynamoDB
	\end{itemize}
	\item EX: serverless CRON job
	\begin{itemize}
		\item CW event rule to trigger every 1 hr
		\item integrated with a lambda function
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lambda Limits}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Execution
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Memory: 128 MB - 10GB
		\item Time: 900 seconds
		\item Env vars 4KB
		\item Disk capacity in the "function container": 512 MB
		\item Concurrency: 1000
	\end{itemize}
	\item Deployment
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Deployment size compressed: 50mb
		\item Uncompressed: 250mb
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lambda@Edge}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deploy lambda functions alongside each region in the world with a CloudFront CDN
	\item Build more responsive applications, no need to manage servers, customize CDN content
	\item Can use lambda to change CloudFront requests and responses
	\begin{itemize}
		\item After CF receives request from a viewer (viewer request)
		\item Before CF forwards request to the origin (origin request)
		\item After CF receives the response from the origin (origin response)
		\item Before CF forwards the response to the viewer (viewer response)
	\end{itemize}
	\item EX: Global application, static website hosted on S3, user visits website, dynamic API to CF
\end{itemize}

\section{DynamoDB}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Serverless DB, NoSQL - not relational
	\item Scales to massive workloads, distributed database
	\item Fast and consistent in performance (low latency)
	\item Made of tables, each table with a primary key
	\item Each table can have an infinite number of items (rows)
	\item Each item has attributes
	\item Provisioned Throughput
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Table must have provisioned read and write capacity units
		\item Read Capacity Units (RCU): throughput for reads
		\item 1 RCU = 1 strongly consistent read of 4kB/sec
		\item 1 RCU = 2 eventually consistent read of 4kb/sec
		\item Write Capacity Units (WCU): throughput for writes
		\item 1 WCU = 1 write of 1kb/sec
		\item Can set up auto-scaling of throughput to meet demand
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advanced Features}
\begin{itemize}
	\item DAX = DynamoDB accelerator, seamless cache for DynamoDB
	\item Streams, changes in DynamoDB can end up in a DynamoDB stream. Stream can be read by Lambda
	\item Transactions - all or nothing type of operations
	\item On demand - no capacity planning needed, automatic scaling
	\item Global tables - cross region replication
\end{itemize}

\section{API Gateway}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create REST APIs for a client
	\item clients talk to API Gateway which will then proxy the request to the lambda function
	\item API Gateway + Lambda: no infra to manage
	\item Support for Web Socket protocol
	\item Transform and validate responses/requests
	\item Integrations
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Lambda
		\item HTTP - expose HTTP endpoints in the backend
		\item AWS Service - expose any AWS API through API Gateway (EX: start AWS Step function)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Endpoint Types
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Edge Optimized: for global clients, is the default
		\item Regional: for client in the same region
		\item Private: only accessed from your VPC
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security}
\begin{itemize}
	\item IAM Permissions - create IAM policy authorization and attach to user/role
	\item API Gateway verifies IAM permissions
	\item Lambda Authorizer - use Lambda to validate the token in header being passed
	\item Cognito User Pools - cognito fully manages user lifecycle, API Gateway verifies identity automatically from AWS Cognito. No need to write custom code
\end{itemize}

\section{AWS Cognito}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We want to give our users an identity so they can interact with our application
	\item Cognito User Pools - sign in functionality
	\item Cognito Identity Pools - Federated identity, allow users to access AWS resources directly
	\item Cognito Sync - Synchronize data from device to Cognito
\end{itemize}

\section{Serverless Application Model}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Framework for developing and deploying serverless application
	\item all the configuration is YAML
	\item Helps you run serverless stuff locally
	\item Can use code deploy to deploy lambda functions
\end{itemize}
