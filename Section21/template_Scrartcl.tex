\section{Choosing the right database}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Based on architecture
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Read-heavy, write-heavy, or balanced workload?
		\item Throughput needs
		\item How much data to store and for how long? Will it grow?
		\item Data durability?
		\item Latency rqts
		\item Schema type?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Database types
	\begin{itemize}
		\item RDBMS (SQL/OLTP): RDS, Aurora - great for joins
		\item NoSQL: DynamoDB (JSON), ElastiCache (k/v pairs), Neptune (graph) - no SQL
		\item Object store: S3 for big objects, Glacier for backups/archives
		\item Data Warehouse (SQL Analytics): Redshift, Athena
		\item Search: Elastisearch  - free text, unstructured searches
		\item Graphs: Neptune - displays relationships between data
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{RDS}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Managed SQL/NoSQL server
	\item Must provision EC2 and EBS behind the scenes
	\item Security thru IAM/SGs/KMS
	\item Backup and snapshots
	\item Monitoring thru Cloudwatch
	\item Use case: store relational datasets
	\item Multi AZ feature
\end{itemize}

\section{Aurora}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Auto healing capability
	\item Can be global for DR/latency purposes
	\item Define EC2 instance for an instance
	\item Aurora serverless for unpredictable/intermittent workloads
	\item Like RDS with less maintence, more flexibility
\end{itemize}

\section{ElastiCache}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Managed Redis/Memcached
	\item In-memory data store, sub-milisecond latency
	\item Must provision an EC2 instance
	\item Support for Clustering and sharding
	\item Maximum amount of replication and auto scaling capability
	\item Use cases: key/value store, frequent reads/less writes, store session data for websites
\end{itemize}

\section{DynamoDB}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Managed NoSQL db
	\item Serverless provisioned capacity, auto scaling
	\item Could replace ElastiCache as a k/v store
	\item reads can be eventually or strongly consistent
	\item can only query on primary/sort key or indexes
\end{itemize}

\section{S3}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A key/value store for objects
	\item Great for big objects
	\item Serverless, scales infinitely, max object size is 5 TB
\end{itemize}

\section{Athena}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provides a query engine on top of S3 with SQL capabilities
	\item Query data in S3, output results back to S3
	\item use Cases: one time SQL queries, serverless queries
	\item Uses presto
\end{itemize}

\section{Redshift}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Based on postgres, not used for OLTP
	\item OLAP - online analytical processing (analytics and data warehousing)
	\item Columnar storage of data, massive parallel query execution
	\item Data is loaded from S3/DynamoDB
	\item Leader node, compute node
	\item No multi-AZ mode, snapshots are stored in S3, can restore a snapshot into a new cluster
	\item Loading data into Redshift
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Amazon Kinesis, Data Firehouse
		\item S3 using COPY command
		\item EC2 instance via JDBC driver
	\end{itemize}
	\item Redshift spectrum: query data that is already in S3 without loading it. Query is submitted to thousands of redshift spectrum nodes
	\item Faster than Athena because of indexes
\end{itemize}

\section{Glue}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Managed ETL service, useful to prepare and transform data for analytics, fully serverless
	\item Glue Data Catalog - catalog of datasets
	\item Glue Data Crawler will crawl thru your datasets, writes metadata to the catalog, and then used by glue jobs
\end{itemize}

\section{Neptune}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fully managed graph database
	\item High relationship data (EX: social networking or knowledge graphs)
\end{itemize}

\section{ElasticSearch}
\begin{itemize}
	\item EX: in DynamoDB you can only find data via primary key or indexes
	\item You can search any field, even partial matches
	\item good compliment to DynamoDB or other DBs
	\item Provision a cluster of instances and has built in integrations to other services
	\item ELK Stack: ElasticSearch, Kibana, and Logstash
\end{itemize}
